- 👋 Hi, I’m @Millzy696
- 
- I’m interested in running and staying active. I am transitioning over the next 3 years to a new career. I enjoy coding and the challenge of learning a totally new 
- set of skills. I am learning for self-satisfaction, however, if I become proficient, then perhaps a career in development maybe on the cards.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML and CSS.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Anything and everything.
